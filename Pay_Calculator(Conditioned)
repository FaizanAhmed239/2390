/*
This program calculates wages for employees of a company. No number for the employees has been provided
The purpose of this program is to design the payment calculation system of a
company. So, you have to write a program, which inputs employee data of
all employees in the company. Each employee will have three data items:
1. an identification number,
2. the hourly wage rate, and
3. the number of hours worked during a given week.
Each employee is to be paid time and a half for all hours worked over 40. A tax amount of 3.625% of
gross salary will be deducted. The program output should show the employeeâ€™s number and net pay.
Display the total payroll and the average amount paid at the end of the run.
Note: The program should include a function ComputeNetSalary. Identify the arguments and output of
this function yourself.
