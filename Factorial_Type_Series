/*
Write a program to add first seven terms of the following series using a for loop: 
(1/1!) + (2/2!) + (3/3!) . . . . . . . . . . . . . (7/7!)

Note: n! represents factorial of n, which is computed as n*(n-1)*(n-2)â€¦*2*1.
Hint: 
1.	Create a separate function for computing factorial.
2.	Apply the running sum pattern on each term of above equation.
